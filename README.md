# ft-junior-eng-tech-task

When provided the task to complete for the Junior Engineer application, my first task was to split up the project into smaller parts:

Tasks:

1. Initial basic website (html, css, script.js) including relevant text only
2. Access API via Postman
3. Incorporate styling via Origami
4. Add API call to website to display headlines
5. Add searching function
6. Testing

While I was able to access the API via Postman and call the API via a local node.js server, I was unable to work out how to convert the API JSON response into javascript objects which I could display on the website. I repeatedly received a C0RS error response when I attempted to create the website on my local machine or via online website editors such as Glitch. Therefore, I have included the code which I have put together so far which comments explaining what I am trying to accomplish.
